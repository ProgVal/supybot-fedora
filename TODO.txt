- wiki [[Page name]] snarfer that prints back a link to the wiki (maybe even
  check for redirects, too)
- fix ext and fasinfo to report whether a Fedora Talk extension is enabled or
  disabled (not currently possible, the config setting is only readable by
  that user, not anybody)
- function to query the last time the cache was refreshed
- make denotations to whether a user is a sponsor or admin in a group in
  .fasinfo
